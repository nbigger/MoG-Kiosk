    <string name="artist_subbio">David was born in Central Pennsylvania
        in 1968 and studied at the Rhode Island School of Design from
        1989‐93. After graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design
        in 1993, he moved to Seattle to work for Dale Chihuly and  many
        highly regarded artists in the Puget Sound area and beyond.</string>
    <string name="artistFrag_bio_title">About the Artist</string>
    <string name="artistFrag_bio">
        After receiving his BFA in Glass from the Rhode Island School of Design,
        David Walters moved to Seattle to work for Dale Chihuly, for whom he
        still works to this day. There, he met Lino Tagliapietra and also began
        working as his assistant, a role he has had for 17 years that has taken
        him all over the world and provided the central influence in his life and
        work. Walters began experimenting with his signature painted enamel on
        glass technique during a 1995 residency at the Creative Glass Center of
        America in Millville, NJ (where he had another residency in 2004), an
        intricate narrative style that distinguishes him from other glass artists.
        \n
        \n
        Walters begins by blowing a milky white glass—into serpentine vessels,
        distorted eggs at times festooned with hats, hyperbolic pitchers and vases,
        toy cars, and other fantastic shapes. They become the canvas for his
        minimally colored (mostly black, some primary yellow, blue, and red) exquisitely
        rendered drawings. Walters calls upon the slightly macabre archetypes of fairy
        tales and Grimm’s nursery rhymes to tell a moral tale about the nature of human
        actions and consequences.  Walters exposes the challenges of modern living—our
        ability to face life’s pitfalls, manage our desires, and live selflessly—when
        society often  shields us against reality, pushes us to give in to instant
        gratification, and rewards us for forgetting our moral compass. But Walters’
        message is not one of mere indictment; rather it is a salve against
        desensitization, connecting us to our humanity and steering us off the path to
        ruin. Though the work uses a deeply personal vocabulary, we are all able to
        relate to the struggle to overcome darkness and embrace the hope of the human
        spirit. Walters is showing us that we need to look within, not without, to find
        our own fulfillment.
        \n
        \n
        Like many glass artists, Walters is a perpetual student of his craft but also
        guides the next generation, teaching at various institutions from Haystack School
        of Crafts (Deer Isle, ME), to Pilchuck Glass School (Stanwood, WA), Pittsburgh
        Glass Center (PA), Illinois State University (Normal, IL), and Emporia State
        University (Lyon, KS). He has had numerous solo gallery and museum exhibitions and
        was featured in Lino e Amici at Fuller Museum of Art (Brockton, MA) and the
        Living Legacies Show at the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, WA.

    <!-- String related to About Page -->
    <string name="about_title">About the Kiosk</string>
    <string name="about_text">
        This kiosk was designed by a team of four Computer Science
        students from the University of Puget Sound: Ayse Hunt, Kayla
        Ramos, Marwan Johnstone, and Nick Bigger. The idea for this
        project stemmed from research that Ayse completed as part of
        her undergraduate thesis studying the use of educational
        technology in art museums. This work suggests the potential
        of digital tools to provide uniquely flexible and
        self-directed learning experiences for museum visitors.
        \n
        \n
        Ayse pitched the idea of creating an interactive kiosk to
        feature video content to the rest of the team in November
        2018. From there, the team decided to build an application
        that would showcase a particular piece of art, including
        biographical information about the artist and video of the
        piece\'s creation.
        \n
        \n
        This project was made possible with help of Rebecca Engelhardt,
        Katie Buckingham, and Professor Adam A Smith. In addition we\'d
        like to thank the following donors for their generous help in fund the
        purchase of this tablet"
